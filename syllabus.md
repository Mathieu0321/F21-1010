## Overview of the class

Python is becoming a more important language.  In some analysis is is the most
important language.  Job sites show that Python is the most in-demand job.
Python was designed to be easy to learn.

In this class we will cover the basics of programming, automated testing,
source code control (git), and how to convert requirements into programs.
Some time will be spent using a variety of tools that are common to
most modern software development.

In the second half of the class we will focus on using TensorFlow 2.x.  and Kereas
a library on top of TensorFlow that makes the creation of data pipelines and
machine learning relatively easy.   A significant emphasis will also be on using
Pandas and NumPy to engineer data so that it is suitable for use in a
machine learning context.   The experience with advanced data manipulation
libraries like Pandas and NumPy is useful outside the area of Machine Learning.

Throughout the class we will be using a number of tools.
Visual Studio Code will be used for editing text and other files.
Python 3.8 will be the version of Python that we are working with.  This is the Anaconda install version of Python.
The exact version of Python is the Anaconda 64 bit release of Python.
We will use TensorFlow 2.x.
Realistically you should install these tools on on your own computer.    They work on Mac,
Windows, and Linux.   I do 80% of my development on a Linux system, 15%
on Mac and 5% on Windows.  We will also use a tool called Jupyter Notebooks.
This is a layer on top of Python.

(You won't need this installed for a while, but...)
TensorFlow 2.x: https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html


## Required texts

We will be covering the first 1/2 of the book in learning Python
(pages 1 ... 318).  
*Python Crash Course* by Eric Mathers, 2nd edition.
At this point in time Amazon notes that it
is the best selling Python book of all time.  

There will be outside reading also.  I will provide links or .pdfs.

## Required Activity

You are expected/required to visit office hours at least once during the semester.
Come with a question - any question.  It need not be class related.

## Homework is Required

Most of the class grade comes from the homework.  Specifically 30% of the semester grade is
from the midterm and the final.  15% from Midterm, 15% from Final.  The final is cumulative.

## Extra credit

No extra credit is planned at this time.

## Late work.

Generally it is a good idea to get the homework done on time.   Normally I take 10% off for each
week day that a homework is late until it is worth only 40% of the original points.  The last day
for turning in homework is Dec 10 at Midnight.  No homework will be accepted after this point.

## Original work policy (in this class).

Homework is turned in online via file upload.   The homework is really, really important.  Do your own work.
That is how you learn.  If you use google or other web sources, then note where you got the code or answer from.
If you copy from the web, then expect that on a one-on-one basis I will be asking you how the code works.   You can
help each other on homework and in the Lab.  Tests (Midterm and Final) you are not allowed to help each other.
It is legitimate in this class to use the web for homework and lab work, (it may not be in other classes).   If you
do then note it in comments your code.  Code is very unique to each person.  If two of you turn in the same code
and do not clearly note that you helped each other - that is very bad.  If you note that you worked on it together
- and then I ask each of you to explain how it works - that's alright.  If you have questions about this email me.
If you use code from the web then expect that I will be asking about what the copyright and license terms are for the
code.  Not all code that is published can be reused.    Also be aware that I put hidden data flaws into assignments.
For example the accurate size of a tennis ball is 2.575 inches.  In previous years I have used 2.5, 2.6 and
 this year 2.75 inches.  If you ask a previous year student for the answers and turn that in
you will have  wrong result.  If you just copy from the web you will have a wrong result.



## Title IX – Duty to Report

The University of Wyoming faculty are committed to helping create a safe learning environment for all students and for
the university as a whole. If you have experienced any form of gender or sex-based discrimination or harassment,
including sexual assault, sexual harassment, relationship violence, or stalking, know that help and support are
available. The University has staff members trained to support survivors in navigating campus life, accessing health and
counseling services, providing academic and housing accommodations, and more. The University strongly encourages all
students to report any such incidents to the University. Please be aware that all University of Wyoming employees,
including student staff, are required to report all Title IX related concerns to the Title IX Coordinator or their
supervisor. This means that if you tell a faculty member about a situation of sexual harassment or sexual violence, or
other related misconduct, the faculty member must share that information with the University’s Title IX Coordinator.
UW’s Title IX Coordinator is Jim Osborn (Manager of Investigations, Equal Opportunity Report and Response). He is
located in Room 320 of the Bureau of Mines Building, and can be reached via email at report-it@uwyo.edu or via phone at
766-5200 or 766-5228. For more information, go to:

## Classroom Behavior Policy

(This section is not really applicable to this class - we will have class discussions that this applies to)

At all times, treat your presence in the classroom and your enrollment in this course as you would a job. Act
professionally, arrive on time, pay attention, complete your work in a timely and professional manner. You will be
respectful towards your classmates and instructor. Spirited debate and disagreement are to be expected in any classroom
and all views will be heard fully, but at all times we will behave civilly and with respect towards one another.
Personal attacks, offensive language, name-calling, and dismissive gestures are not warranted in a learning atmosphere.
As the instructor, I have the right to dismiss you from the classroom.

## Classroom Statement on Diversity

The University of Wyoming values an educational environment that is diverse, equitable, and inclusive. The diversity
that students and faculty bring to class, including age, country of origin, culture, disability, economic class,
ethnicity, gender identity, immigration status, linguistic, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation,
veteran status, worldview, and other social and cultural diversity is valued, respected, and considered a resource for
learning.

## Disability Support

If you have a physical, learning, sensory or psychological disability and require accommodations, please register as
soon as possible and provide documentation of your disability to Disability Support Services (DSS), Room 109 Knight
Hall. You may also contact DSS at (307) 766-3073 or udss@uwyo.edu. Visit their website for more
information: www.uwyo.edu/udss

## Academic Dishonesty Policies

Dont cheat on the exams. I expect you to take full advantage of all the online resources you can get your hands on.
That includes Stack Overflow, Github etc. If you do use someone else's code, put in a link to where you found it.
Don't cheat on the projects - do you own work.  Most of the learning in the class is from *doing* the projects.

## Substantive changes to syllabus

All deadlines, requirements, and course structure are subject to change if deemed necessary by the instructor. Students
will be notified verbally in class, on our WyoCourses page announcement, and via email of these changes. I do travel
during the semester. Class could be canceled or assignments due dates changed.
