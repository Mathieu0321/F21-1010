# Lecture 6 - Lists / Dictionaries / Git

## First let's read in a file

```
m4_include(read-file.py)
```

## List Example

<!--
Read in  A List - of People w/ Phone Numbers
Search List
Output A Result
-->

```
m4_include(search-list.py)
```

## Dictionary

<!-- Explain Dictionary -->
A dictionary is an association between a "key" value and a set of data
that is efficient for looking thins up by the key.

let's do an "age" one...

```
>>> dd = {}
>>> dd["bob"] = 22
>>> dd["jane"] = 31
>>> dd["marry"] = 18
>>>
>>> dd["bob"]
>>> dd["jane"]
```

Now changing our phone search to use a  dictionary:

```
m4_include(search-dict.py)
```


### Let's count some words

```
m4_include(word-count.py)
```
