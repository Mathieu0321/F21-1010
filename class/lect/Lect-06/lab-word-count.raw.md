# Lab XXXXX - word frequency

## Requirements

### Input: File Name

### Output: A sorted list of words with the frequency of each word

### Description of Problem

Prompt for a file name. 
Then read in a file of text.  
Split the file up into words.
Remove any punctuation and convert each word to lower case.
Count how many times each word occurs.  Print out a sorted
list of the words in the file with the number of occurrences
of each word.  Sort from the most frequent word to the least.
