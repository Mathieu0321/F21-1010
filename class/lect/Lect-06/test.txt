absent members, in such manner, and under such penalties as each
house may provide.



each house may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its
members for disorderly behaviour, and, with the concurrence of two
thirds, expel a member.



each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time
to time publish the same, excepting such parts as may in their
judgment require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of
either house on any question shall, at the desire of one fifth of
those present, be entered on the journal.

whereof shall have been encreased during such time; and no person
holding any office under the united states, shall be a member of
either house during his continuance in office.

the senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the
president of the united states; if he approve he shall sign it, but
if not he shall return it, with his objections to that house in
which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at
large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it. if after such
reconsideration two thirds of that house shall agree to pass the
bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other
house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved
by two thirds of that house, it shall become a law. but in all such
cases the votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays,
and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall
be entered on the journal of each house respectively. if any bill
shall not be returned by the president within ten days (sundays
excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall
be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the congress
by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall not
be a law.
