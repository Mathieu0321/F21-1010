# Lecture 01 - Intro To Class

[https://xkcd.com/353/](https://xkcd.com/353/)

Who is Prof Philip Schlump?  

Can you make Money at computer science?

Yes - it pays.
The level of opportunity has never been better.


What it takes to be successful? 
Success is Easy to explain.  Be willing to do what other people 
are unwilling to do.  How this applies to you - right
now.  When you learn to program you are dogging something
that most people are unwilling to do.  Programming is
hard.  It is the most difficult computer game ever.
There is never a day that it is "easy".  It is not a
"talent".  It is a "Skill" that you can learn.  It is
a process that you can practices and learn.

You practice and you learn to program.   You lean a valuable
skill.  This is valuable.  On average a UW graduate will
make $86,200.00 in this field.   You can expect to get
raises for about 6 years.  An average of $112,000.00 
a year.   Will you make more if you move to NYNY - yep.
Will you make less in Omaha NE - yep.  Cost of living is
different in each location.

That is fantastic.  You will not be "rich" by any means.
To create "wealth" you have to move beyond a job and
build a business.  Consulting can pay way more than
just a job.  My last consulting gig was 14.5 months at
$16,000.00 a month.  If you want to make more than 
that you need to start and run a successful business.
Don't think that a "successful business" means just a
computer company.   I have a friend in Denver, with a
masters in Computer Science from UW that now owns
9 Great Clips - each making more than $50k per year.
She is no longer doing development work.

In a consulting business I did a contract with Time
Warner.  I had 23 folks that I placed with them. On
average I made 41.20 and hour for 6 months on each
hour of other peoples work.  I leave the math to you.

I built a VC funded product company.
Do you think there were hard
times in balding that.  You bet.  At one point I went out
on a trip to sell the software.  We had $38.15 in the
bank account.  With a little over $10k due in 2 weeks 
for labor.   My CEO and I had not take a pay check in
7 months.  My wife and children had the flue. I returned
12 days later with a check from a customer for $140,000.00.

After selling the product company I took 11 years off.
My wife and I bought a sailboat - we raised our kits
on a boat on the eat cost and Caribbean.

## How the Gig economy works

Who is me article in Time: [https://time.com/6085525/big-tech-data-centers/](https://time.com/6085525/big-tech-data-centers/)

1. Jobs  are never permanent.  Contracts have a fixed end date.  Labor laws in us say that a "Contractor" is a "temporary" only if they work for less than 18 months and then have 6 months off.
2. Burdened cost.  At UW it is 1.48 - other people will have 1.52 to 1.58 is common.  So you get a "job" the cost to the business is Pay(gross) * 1.48.  100k a year means that the business cost is 148000 a year.   As a contractor you get X + 148000 per year - but you have to pay your own matching tax, your health insurance, your retirement etc.
3. Big businesses have lots of leverage v.s. small city organizations.
4. Cost of Replacement is very high.  It costs $25k to $50k to hire a new person.
5. Jobs are only worth what the "kind" of a job pays.   If a programmer pays 100k to 105k that is it.  If you as a programmer are way better than others you still get 100k to 105k.   If you want more then you have to get out of the "employee" mentality and build some form of a business.
