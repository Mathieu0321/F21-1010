<!-- Homework 4:

2. Write a program that reads in a list from user and prints every third element of the list.
Write a faction that reads in a list from the user and returns the list.   Test this function.
Write a faction that prints every 3rd element in the list.  Write code to test this function with varying size lists.
Write a main program that calls the functions.
3. Write a program that reads in a list from user (re-use your code from (1)) and creates a new list with a reverse order.  Then print out the list.
Write a function that will reverse the order of elements in a list and return a new list with a reverse order.  Write a test for this.
4. Write a program to read in a list and search the list for the smallest value in the list.  Print that value out.
Implement a set of test code that verifies you function finds the smallest value in the list.  Your test should include lists
with 0, 1, 2, 4 and 5 elements in it.   Have a test case with a list with duplicate values in it.

5. Find the sum of each row and each column  of matrix of size m x n. For example for the following matrix output will be like this :
```
	[ 4 8 13 ]
	[ 5 7 1  ]
	[ 1 2 3  ]
```

Sum of row 1 = ?? 
Sum of row 2 = ?? 
Sum of row 3 = 6
Sum of column 1 = 10
Sum of column 2 = ?? 
Sum of column 3 = ??

6. Write a program to add two matrices of size n x m.
