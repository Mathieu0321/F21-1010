## Lab 2 - Questions (Same as in Assignment 2)

Use the conversion programs that you have written to answer these questions.

Questions are answered by doing a write up as a .md or .markdown (text) file in lab.
The write-up should be written in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

Use markdown [https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for the formatting of your
text file answers.

This portion should be turned in as a part of your lab.

It is worth 100pts.

1. 5pts - What is the closest star to planet Earth?  Think! It shines on you every day.
2. 10pts - Approximately how many exoplanets have been identified? (Use Google)
	Explain why you think this answer from Google and other sources
	is valid.   Find a list of Kupier belt objects.  How many are there?
	How far is it to the Kupier Belt in miles and kilometers?  How far is it to the Oort Cloud in miles and kilometers?
3. 10pts - How far is it to the Trappist-1 system In Light Years?
	In miles and kilometers in our model, how far to this system?
4. 10pts - At the speed of light how far is it from Laramie to Tokyo Japan?  Answer in fractions of a second.
5. 10pts - If the Sun in our model is the size of a tennis ball, then
	how far is to Proxima Centauri 4.3 light years from us?
	In Miles and in kilometers?   In Feet and meters?  
	Calculate for our tennis ball model  the number of miles	
	that 4.3 light years represents.  Using Google Maps - find a city
    that is approximately the same number of miles from 
    Laramie to that city as our model calculates.   How
    long will it take you to drive from Laramie to that city? Use appriximate number of hours of driving time from Google Maps.
	Will you be able to see the tennis ball from that location? (Yes/No)
6. 5pts - Using the same calculation, L 95-59 is 35 light years 
	from Earth. Use your program to calcualte the number
	of miles and kilometers to L 95-59.   For the tennis ball model calculate the number of miles in our model to L 95-59?
7. 15pts - If the Sun is a tennis ball, how big are each of the planets - in inches or thousandths of an inch?
8. 5pts - How big is the Moon in thousandths of inches in our model and how far from Earth in inches?
9. 5pts -How far is it to the Kupier Belt in miles and kilometers?  How far in miles in the tennis ball model?  If you are in Prixies Pasture at the "family" statue, put the Sun there - where will the Kupier Belt be?
10. 5pts - How far is it to the Oort Cloud in miles and kilometers? How far in miles in the tennis ball model? If you are in Prixies Pasture at the "family" statue, put the Sun there - where will the Oort Cloud be?
11. 10pts - Cygnus-x-1 is at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, 29,000 light years from earth.   How many miles is that?
12. 10pts - Ligo detected a black hole merger [https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20200902](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20200902)
   of gw190521.  How many light years is that away from earth? (See: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW190521](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW190521).  How far away is that in miles?  Use 1,000,000,000 for a billion.

Write up your answers in a text file (not Microsoft Word, or .pdf).
